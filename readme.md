# Instructions

`build-asm.py` turns `firstiso/first.flp`
`build-iso.py` turns `firstiso/` into `first.iso`.

You can load `first.iso` into the virtual disk drive of a VirtualBox VM.

You can also use the built-in Windows 10 disk-burning utility `isoburn.exe` to
burn it to a physical CD. (You may have to disassociate other programs for the
option to show up in Windows explorer)
